## Description

This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments from the **Programming Languages course (Parts [A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages), [B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b), and [C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c)) on Coursera**. I tackled these problems with a beginner-level programming background, so this reflects my learning journey through the course."
